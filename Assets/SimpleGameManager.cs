    /*
     * Don't look in this section! It's far too advanced for you!
     *
     * Seriously, let's take a look, and I'll try to explain some
     * of it. Computers are very good at keeping track of lists,
     * so let's make the computer keep track of our quests for us!
     *
     * We'll start with a Dictionary, named quests, which is a list
     * of keys (the terms), and values (the definitions). We'll
     * make this a Dictionary with strings for keys, and booleans
     * for values. We can add quests to this dictionary when we use
     * this class's constructor method.
     *
     * The last bit of wizardry is in our AdvancedFinishQuest
     * method! Rather than use all of those if/else statements
     * or a switch/case statement, we can simplify things an
     * incredible amount by just looking up the value in the
     * quests Dictionary: quests.ContainsKey("name of key").
     * If we find the key, we set the key's value to true!
     * If we don't find it, we just exit the method: no harm,
     * no foul!
     *
     * Season lightly with some Debug.Log statements, and you've
     * got a nice, compact method that's pretty easy to under-
     * stand, and to debug!
     *
     * I've left some of this code for you to figure out.
     *
     * Good Luck!
